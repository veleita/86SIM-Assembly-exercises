# 86SIM-Assembly-exercises
Exercises from Randall Hyde's book The Art Assembly Language, chapter three

The SIMx86 prigram contains a built-in assembler (compiler), debugger, and interrupter for the x86 (hypothetical CPU described in the third chapter of the book, basically a simplification of the real 80x86 Intel CPUs).

I have been working on a Windows 7 (32 bits) virtual machine to execute the SIMx86, and I have created and tested the programs (.X86 files) from there. However, the SIMx86 will unlikely work on its own without the prior installation of some of the files included on the software appended to The Art of Assembly Language textbook. Please consult the textbook for further information about this installation.
