# 86SIM-Assembly-exercises
Exercises from Randall Hyde's book The Art Assembly Language, chapter three

The SIMx86 prigram contains a built-in assembler (compiler), debugger, and interrupter for the x86 (hypothetical CPU described in the third chapter of the book, basically a simplification of the real 80x86 Intel CPUs).

I have been working on a Windows 7 (32 bits) virtual machine to execute the SIMx86, and I have created and tested the programs (.X86 files) from there.
